                        <p>
                            The game Florist is a mobile simulation adventure game about
                            <span class="highlight highlight-florist shown">learning how to identify common
                            plants.
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The game as a guide to getting started to distinguish plants allows the player to
                            build a knowledge base of plants, learn plant identification, and learn more about the
                            influence of climate conditions. The game mechanic is based on observation of plants
                            through
                            the DIY specimen cards process, including examining plant characteristics and typing
                            names.
                            The playerâ€™s job as a museum keeper is to fill the collection with new plant species and
                            samples. Among the creatures, some of them are Medicinal herbs or edible, while some are
                            toxic and dangerous. We follow the DPE framework (Winn, 2009) to design the game, which
                            consists of four parts, namely, learning, storytelling, gameplay, and user experience.

                    <p> The game revolves around the player as a botanist for the museum they are creating in a gameplay
                        loop, shown in figure 1. The player needs to <span class="florist-underline">fill up the museum with plants</span>
                        (see prototype 1) so
                        that it may thrive. To do this the player must enter the gameâ€™s map, shown in prototype 2, and
                        explore the levels in the map, shown in prototype 3. In each level, the player will be able to
                        view and identify plants. There will also be quests presented in the levels by non-player
                        characters (NPCs) to identify and bring plants to them. These NPCs will also be there to provide
                        some information to help identify plants. Quests from NPCs can occur both before and after the
                        player finds and collects a plant. Doing an NPCs quest will give the player rewards, usually an
                        extra seed that the player can use in their museum or unlock the new map. </p>
                    <p>
                        When out in the world, the player will need to <span class="florist-underline">identify plants to end up earning them, whether
                        on their own or through the quests</span>. The identify mode, as pictured in prototype 4, will
                        have the
                        player make use of the info the character currently knows on every plant. By using identifying
                        features, like leaves, roots, and climate, the player can correctly find the plant they are
                        looking for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the level design we can see where the player must <span class="florist-underline">find information on plants and use the
                        general information to identify plants</span>. The NPC quests will also provide the player with
                        the use
                        of the plant that they are identifying. The game also provides the player with how plants are
                        identified and what it takes to identify through the journal.

            <h3>Learning Theory</h3>
            <hr class="solid">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-10">
                    <h4>Information Processing: Ausubelâ€™s <span class="florist-underline">Assimilation Theory</span>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        According to Ausubelâ€™s assimilation theory (1962), meaningful learning occurs when <span
                            class="highlight highlight-florist shown">new
                        information interacts with the individualâ€™s cognitive structure that serves as an anchor to
                        integrate the new content into prior knowledge</span>. Instead of instilling decontextualized
                        facts, we
                        try to build connections between knowledge and provide friction to have learners interact with
                        the content in the game, instead of letting information smoothly pass learners.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Constructionism</h4>
                    <p>
                        Constructionism occurs through <span
                            class="highlight highlight-florist shown">the learner creating an entity or artifact, usually public,
                        connecting to a certain subject to create a physical version of the ideas presented (Kafai,
                        2005)</span>. To do this, the learner should also be involved with the subject, not just studied
                        in the
                        distance, where the learner/learning is grounded (Steels & Tokoro, 2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our game aims to follow these rules through its <span
                            class="highlight highlight-florist shown">gameplay goal and sandbox</span>. The player is
                        given a
                        large world where they play the role of a botanist for their own museum. The playerâ€™s goal is to
                        fill up the museum with plants from around the world. The end goal is to create an artifact, the
                        museum, where the culmination of their learning is put in one place. The role the player plays
                        is meant to ground them in the learning as someone involved with the subject. The gameplay of
                        using the game's notes to help identify plants also grounds the player and creates an individual
                        entity for the player to put in their museum. The npcs also help create an immersion that what
                        the player is doing fulfills a role that the learning they are using is useful.

                    <h4>Skills as Strategies</h4>
                    <p>People learn and practice skills best when they <span class="florist-underline">see related skills as strategies to accomplish
                        goals</span> they want to accomplish (Gee, 2015).</p>
                    <p>
                        In our game, no matter whether players explore the world by themselves or accomplish the NPC
                        quests, to achieve the goal of exhibiting their collection of plants and collecting the plant
                        for people in need, players would practice recognizing plants by poring over the features. If
                        they want to help NPC to collect the plants with sleep aids, they need to first speculate where
                        the plant is grown by examining the plantsâ€™ growth conditions such as sunlight, proper
                        temperature, moisture, air and nutrients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In other words, with a clear goal and strategies, players would <span
                            class="highlight highlight-florist shown">know how the practice and the
                        goal fit together and why they need to practice over and over again</span>.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Sandbox</h4>
                    <p>
                        We would like to make the game as a sandbox where players can practice recognizing the exploring
                        different plants with mitigated risks and dangers, but still feel a sense of achievement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If they fail, they can try again. The failure would be informative, instead of a final judgment
                        of playersâ€™ ability, so that players are encouraged to take the risks.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Cycle of Expertise</h4>
                    <p>
                        As we mentioned above, the game provides two different paths of the game, namely, collecting plants in the world and identifying plants based on the features, or examining features first then looking for the plants in the world. Two paths enable players to get multiple exposures of topics over time as the first path starts with working on a big concept then down to specific features of plants (top down), and the second path starts with detailed features then comes to find out the plants (bottom up). The cycle of expertise allows players to learn new things, and meanwhile, to integrate the new and old one.

                    <p>
                        The game system was tested live with 4 outpatients with hemiplegia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Participants were given an explanation of the game and presented with the gestures.
                        They first familiarized themselves with the operation and gameplay and then played several
                        rounds.
                        Participants had a several-minute rest after each round.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the test, we asked users to rate how effective they think the game would be, and
                        interviewed them how they felt about their game experience.
                        The user feedback is summarized below.

                    <p>
                        To bring the game system into the routine practice of stroke rehabilitation, we need to
                        improve
                        it from the perspective of game design and rehabilitation, and:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            follow up randomized controlled clinical trials for a long period
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            gather large-size samples, especially for therapists to determine an optimal duration
                            and
                            intensity of the treatment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            find quantitative measurements for game performance to evaluate patient medical progress
                            with clinicians, therapists, and researchers.

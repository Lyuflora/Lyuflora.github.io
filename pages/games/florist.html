                        <p>
                            The game Florist is a mobile simulation adventure game about
                            <span class="highlight highlight-florist shown">learning how to identify common
                            plants.
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The game as a guide to getting started to distinguish plants allows the player to
                            build a knowledge base of plants, learn plant identification, and learn more about the
                            influence of climate conditions. The game mechanic is based on observation of plants
                            through
                            the DIY specimen cards process, including examining plant characteristics and typing
                            names.
                            The player’s job as a museum keeper is to fill the collection with new plant species and
                            samples. Among the creatures, some of them are Medicinal herbs or edible, while some are
                            toxic and dangerous. We follow the DPE framework (Winn, 2009) to design the game, which
                            consists of four parts, namely, learning, storytelling, gameplay, and user experience.

                    <h4>Level Design</h4>
                    <p>
                        The game revolves around the player as a botanist for the museum they are creating in a gameplay
                        loop, shown in figure 1. The player needs to fill up the museum with plants (see prototype 1) so
                        that it may thrive. To do this the player must enter the game’s map, shown in prototype 2, and
                        explore the levels in the map, shown in prototype 3. In each level, the player will be able to
                        view and identify plants. There will also be quests presented in the levels by non-player
                        characters (NPCs) to identify and bring plants to them. These NPCs will also be there to provide
                        some information to help identify plants. Quests from NPCs can occur both before and after the
                        player finds and collects a plant. Doing an NPCs quest will give the player rewards, usually an
                        extra seed that the player can use in their museum or unlock the new map.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When out in the world, the player will need to identify plants to end up earning them, whether
                        on their own or through the quests. The identify mode, as pictured in prototype 4, will have the
                        player make use of the info the character currently knows on every plant. By using identifying
                        features, like leaves, roots, and climate, the player can correctly find the plant they are
                        looking for.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the level design we can see where the player must find information on plants and use the
                        general information to identify plants. The NPC quests will also provide the player with the use
                        of the plant that they are identifying. The game also provides the player with how plants are
                        identified and what it takes to identify through the journal.

                        features according to the guiding brochure. It has wide, flat, dark leaves that are arranged
                        opposite each other.

                    <p>
                        Therapists have developed several clinical methods to indicate motor ability. We have found
                        an
                        evaluation index with higher accuracy for each evaluation object. To evaluate patients'
                        performance and , we decided to use:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            the Integrated Electromyogram (iEMG) to value evaluates Muscle strength

                        <li>the Root Mean Square to value evaluates Muscle tension</li>
                        <li>and the slope of the plot of the average power frequency value time series to measure

                        by
                        the ZJU-CAPG group.
                        It introduces the concept of an sEMG image and conducts gesture recognition based on sEMG
                        images
                        with a classification scheme of a deep convolutional network.
                        The resultant recognition a ccuracy reached reached 99.0% using simple majority voting over
                        40
                        frames with little observational latency.

                        Bluetooth. Its metal contacts can measure electrical activity in users' forearm muscles.

                        tasks by creating interest and enjoyment.

                        Participants were given an explanation of the game and presented with the gestures.
                        They first familiarized themselves with the operation and gameplay and then played several
                        rounds.
                        Participants had a several-minute rest after each round.

                    <p>
                        After the test, we asked users to rate how effective they think the game would be, and
                        interviewed them how they felt about their game experience.
                        The user feedback is summarized below.

                        To bring the game system into the routine practice of stroke rehabilitation, we need to
                        improve
                        it from the perspective of game design and rehabilitation, and:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            follow up randomized controlled clinical trials for a long period
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            gather large-size samples, especially for therapists to determine an optimal duration
                            and
                            intensity of the treatment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            find quantitative measurements for game performance to evaluate patient medical progress
                            with clinicians, therapists, and researchers.
                        </li>

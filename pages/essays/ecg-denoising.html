                            When I was looking for a specific application that was related to digital signal processing, I found  the electrocardiographic (ECG) signals and its denoising process. The wave characteristics of ECG signal indicate the possible symptom of heart disease; in addition, it is increasingly common that cardiac disorders caused from many kinds of reasons are killing people. Recognizing abnormal heart rhythm through ECG signals allows doctors to make predictions and judgements on heart conditions evaluation and provide timely treatment. However, ECG signal collected from the human skin is contaminated by different sources of noise. Therefore, I carried out this research on the denoising of ECG signals in both acquisition and processing stage.

                            Electrical activities of the heart can be picked up via

                            connecting to a ECG machine which records signals and convert them into graphics. However, there are several problems in the process that make visual inspection and ECG feature extraction from ECG signals difficult:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The collected ECG signal is very weak and can be easily affected by noise.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The main components of the various waves should be retained during the denoising process, but the ECG signal is composed of several waves of different waveforms. Moreover, the interference signal overlaps the frequency band of the ECG signal.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There are many noise components, therefore which denoising method to choose is based on the specific situation.

                            Components of ECG signal
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            ECG is a time-domain signal composed of potential changes caused by activities of the heart. The ECG signal is measured from the chest cavity or body surface by using electrodes, and the analog signal is digitized to trace the collected waveform signal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A normal ECG signal is roughly composed of P wave, QRS complex, T wave, and the intervals and segments between them, as shown in the figure below:

                                 P wave represents the sequential activation (depolarization) of the right and left atria, with an amplitude that usually does not exceed 2.5mV and a duration of no longer than 1s.
                            </li>

                                 QRS complex represents the process of  right and left ventricular depolarization. R wave is the main wave of the complex, and the length of time normally it is 0.06~0.1s. R wave amplitude is generally 0.4~2.4 mV, while Q wave generally does not exceed 0.3mV.

                                 ST segment is the waveform change from the end of QRS complex to the beginning of the T complex. There is no potential difference between the parts, so the normal ST segment is level with the baseline.

                                 T wave represents ventricular repolarization. The amplitude is 0.1~0.8.8mV, and the time length is 0.05~0.25s.

                         <p>
                             In general, ECG contaminants can be classified into different categories:
                         </p>
                         <ul>
                             <li>
                                 power line interference(PLI) 工频干扰
                             </li>
                             <li>
                                 electrode pop or contact noise 电极接触噪声
                             </li>
                             <li>
                                 patient-electrode motion artifacts 运动伪迹
                             </li>
                             <li>
                                 electromyographic (EMG) noise 肌电干扰
                             </li>
                             <li>
                                 baseline wandering 基线漂移
                             </li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>
                             Among these noises, the power line interference and the baseline wandering (BW) are the most significant and can strongly affect ECG signal analysis. Except for these two noises, other noises may be wideband and usually involve a complex stochastic process, which also distorts the ECG signal. The power line interference is narrow-band noise centered at 50 Hz or 60 Hz with a bandwidth of less than 1 Hz. Thus, denoising this type of signals is decisive for further parameter extraction in clinic applications.

                            When checking patient's heart's rhythm and electrical activity, sensors are attached to the skin, and they detect the electrical signals produced by patient's heart each time it beats. Patients are need to remove his/her upper clothing to expose the skin, and keep chest clean. During signal acquisition, the electrodes need to stay where they are in place, in order to reduce Skin-Electrode interlace noise.  The test usually lasts a few minutes.

                <p>
                    When the player is having an ECG, with electrodes stuck to the arms, legs and chest, he/she will solve puzzles that can grab his/her attention from the test itself. In this way, electrode contact noise can be reduced because the patient feel peace and forget about the anxiety and nervous about test.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Gameplay
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The player is given a candy with a puzzle printed on the wrapper when entering the room. He/she lies on the bed, and the doctor put electrodes on the player's body, including his/her chest, arm and leg. After that, the player can observe the stickers that are projected on the screen. Each stick represents a piece of information. The player rolls his/her eyes to select options and chooses his  answer by blinking. The puzzle takes about a few minutes to solve.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Children who is having a ECG or people who are over concerned about such a medical examination and need distractions.
                </p>
                <h4>

                <h3>Signal Processing</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    For processing ECG signals, it is necessary to remove the several types of contaminants mentioned above from these signals. According to the noise type and characteristics, we can choose ECG denoising approaches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the removal of PLI, choose smoothing filter, adaptive filter and discrete wavelet transform(DWT) respectively and observe the denoising result:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The smoothing filter that comes with Matlab is a low-pass filter whose filter coefficient is equal to the reciprocal of the span.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The general principle of the adaptive filter is to obtain the signal component by subtracting the interference signal component from the signal. If the frequency of the interference signal in the original signal (such as the most common 50Hz power frequency interference) is known, the phase and amplitude of the interference signal are obtained and subtracted from the original signal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Discrete wavelet transform(DWT) uses wavelet functions to decompose the signal in multiple layers, which allows  representing a signal by a finite sum of low-frequency and high-frequency wavelet coefficients at different resolutions. Therefore, each component can be denoised with different thresholds and then used to reconstruct the signal.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For baseline wandering, because it will have a great impact on the correct detection of the ST-T segment, it is necessary to reduce the amplitude and phase distortion of the ECG signal when denoising, so as to avoid the obvious deformation of the low-frequency parts such as the ST segment and cause detection distortion. A zero-phase filter is used to correct it. The zero-phase filter uses the information contained in the signal points before and after the current signal point to eliminate phase distortion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For EMG interference, which is manifested as high-frequency noise, it is removed using a Butterworth low-pass filter. The Butterworth filter makes the frequency response curve in the pass band to be as flat as possible, and gradually drops to zero in the stop band.

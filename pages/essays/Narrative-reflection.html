                    <p>The game, twenty-fourteen, is a dictator simulator that takes about three weeks to develop. I
                        take some of the programming work, including file system, mouse interaction, and UI logic. The
                        file system is part of the main mechanic that has functions like grabbing and reading a file,
                        signing a file. I also set up Big Brotherâ€™s workflow through 7 days and ensured each file had
                        correct triggers that could change story branches. According to the initial scripts created by
                        Luke, I made some UI sketching of a top-down view concept, considering the limited space, which
                        was integrated with the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>Later, in the development phase, the design of the file system was the main challenge. However, I
                        did not notice the potential problem until after the first version prototype. The trickiest
                        issue is that the current file system had a different concept from how the story branches,
                        failed to take control of a single file as the dynamic story required. It was because I was not
                        familiar with the scripts at that moment, and the lack of communication between the writer and
                        me. Thanks to my teammates, we together figured out an efficient way to modify the logic and fit
                        the need. This was an important lesson I learned: know my role and influence throughout a
                        project. As a programmer in such a narrative project team, organizing the story and putting it
                        into a straightforward structure is a primary task for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another challenge is to manage the resource the player could access in the game, such as text,
                        image, and thumbnails, and integrate it into the file system. Different types of files have
                        unique looks and effects. As the story scripts increase, a neat and efficient data structure is
                        of great importance. I changed it before the file system finished, saving a lot of time and
                        effort for later development. It was also necessary to keep what I created in the project file
                        well-organized, to make other team members easy to check out and edit. I also managed to
                        separate the resource with the mechanic so as to allow editing game scripts for narrative
                        design. </p>
                    <p>
                        Given the idea of a choice-maker simulator, it was not easy as we thought. We had several
                        discussions on the back story and interactions about how to convey the idea, and the use of
                        metaphor, psychological cue, and the pacing of the game. We took a look at Papers, Please, and
                        The Westport Independent, both dystopian simulator games. They use certain actions to not only
                        build a magic circle making the player immersed, but also give the player clues and convey
                        information in a playful way. Before we could do that, I learned that to scope down and to make
                        the content more accessible should be prioritized before adding more details
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To complete the system before enriching it is helpful. After the file system finished, it was a
                        nice foundation, filled with different types of files, to continue adding features. I added the
                        dialog box and button animations that somehow communicate with the player about what he could
                        do. There is still a lot of space that this project can enrich, like to make the interaction
                        more engaging, to create a better reading experience.
                    </p>
